## Overview

The Intelligence Web Interaction Protocol (IWIP) is an open, vendor-neutral application-layer protocol that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with web applications in a standardized, secure, and efficient manner.  IWIP aims to be the common wiring layer for the next generation of reasoning systems, fostering interoperability and empowering users with control over their data and interactions.
